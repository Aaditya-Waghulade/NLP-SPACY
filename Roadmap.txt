That's a great direction, Aaditya! Since you're already learning **NLP**, you‚Äôre on a solid path toward becoming an **AI Engineer**. Let‚Äôs structure a complete **AI Engineer Learning Path** for you, including what comes **after NLP**, and offer a **summary** of the core skills and milestones.

---

## üéØ AI Engineer Learning Path (2025 Roadmap)

### üìå Stage 1: Foundations (Already completed or familiar with)

* ‚úÖ **Python Programming**
* ‚úÖ **NumPy, Pandas**
* ‚úÖ **Matplotlib, Seaborn (Basic Visualization)**
* ‚úÖ **Basic Machine Learning (scikit-learn)**

---

### üìå Stage 2: Deep Learning Core

> If you haven't done this in-depth yet, revisit before or alongside NLP.

* üìò Neural Networks: perceptrons, backpropagation, loss functions
* üìò Frameworks: TensorFlow (Keras) or PyTorch
* üéØ Projects: Image classification, digit recognition, CNNs, RNNs

---

### ‚úÖ Stage 3: Natural Language Processing (You‚Äôre currently here)

#### Topics to Cover:

* Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopwords
* Word2Vec, GloVe, TF-IDF
* RNNs, LSTMs for text
* **Transformers** (BERT, GPT, etc.)
* HuggingFace Library
* Fine-tuning and inference on custom tasks

#### Must-Do NLP Projects:

* Resume vs JD Matching App (‚úÖ you are working on it)
* Text Summarizer
* Sentiment Analysis App
* Chatbot using RAG or LLM

---

### üîÑ Stage 4: After NLP ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

#### 1. **Multimodal AI (Vision + Language)**

* Combine NLP with images or videos
* Tools: CLIP, BLIP, LLaVA
* Project: Captioning system, image-question answering

#### 2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

* Use LangChain, ChromaDB, Weaviate
* Build smart search or document Q\&A tools
* Project: PDF Q\&A Bot, Enterprise RAG System

#### 3. **MLOps + Model Deployment**

* FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
* Monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana
* Deploy models using: AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, or Local Docker

#### 4. **Fine-tuning + LLMs Customization**

* Train/fine-tune small transformer models
* Tools: LoRA, PEFT, QLoRA
* Project: Personalized chatbot or industry-specific model

#### 5. **Advanced Concepts**

* Reinforcement Learning (RLHF)
* Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
* Generative AI: Diffusion, GANs, Audio generation
